                                <br /><br />You agree to indemnify, defend and hold harmless FBL, its officers, directors, employees,

                                attorney&#x27;s fees) relating to or arising out of your use of or inability to use the Site or
                                services, any user postings made by you, your violation of any terms of this Agreement or your violation
                                of any rights of a third party, or your violation of any applicable laws, rules or regulations. FBL
                                reserves the right, at its own cost, to assume the exclusive defense and control of any matter otherwise
                                subject to indemnification by you, in which event you will fully cooperate with FBL in asserting any
                                available defenses.<br /><br /><strong>Arbitration</strong> <br /><br />In the event the parties are not
                                able to resolve any dispute between them arising out of or concerning these Terms and Conditions, or any
                                provisions hereof, whether in contract, tort, or otherwise at law or in equity for damages or any other
                                relief, then such dispute shall be resolved only by final and binding arbitration pursuant to the
                                Federal Arbitration Act, conducted by a single neutral arbitrator and administered by the American
                                Arbitration Association, or a similar arbitration service selected by the parties, in a location
                                mutually agreed upon by the parties. The arbitrator&#x27;s award shall be final, and judgment may be
                                entered upon it in any court having jurisdiction. In the event that any legal or equitable action,
                                proceeding or arbitration arises out of or concerns these Terms and Conditions, the prevailing party
                                shall be entitled to recover its costs and reasonable attorney&#x27;s fees. The parties agree to
                                arbitrate all disputes and claims in regards to these Terms and Conditions or any disputes arising as a
                                result of these Terms and Conditions, whether directly or indirectly, including Tort claims that are a
                                result of these Terms and Conditions. The parties agree that the Federal Arbitration Act governs the
                                interpretation and enforcement of this provision. The entire dispute, including the scope and
                                enforceability of this arbitration provision shall be determined by the Arbitrator. This arbitration
                                provision shall survive the termination of these Terms and Conditions.<br /><br /><strong>Class Action
                                    Waiver</strong><br /><br />Any arbitration under these Terms and Conditions will take place on an
                                individual basis; class arbitrations and class/representative/collective actions are not permitted. THE
                                PARTIES AGREE THAT A PARTY MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN EACH&#x27;S INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY,
                                AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PUTATIVE CLASS, COLLECTIVE AND/ OR REPRESENTATIVE
                                PROCEEDING, SUCH AS IN THE FORM OF A PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL ACTION AGAINST THE OTHER. Further, unless
                                both you and FBL agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person&#x27;s claims,
                                and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding.

                                OF THE POSSIBILITY OF DAMAGES. BECAUSE SOME STATES/JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR

                                YOU. IF YOU ARE DISSATISFIED WITH ANY PORTION OF THE SITE, OR WITH ANY OF THESE TERMS OF USE, YOUR SOLE

                                    Restriction</strong><br /><br /> FBL reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to terminate your
                                access to the Site and the related services or any portion thereof at any time, without notice. To the
                                maximum extent permitted by law, this agreement is governed by the laws of the State of Georgia and you
                                hereby consent to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of courts in Georgia in all disputes arising out
                                of or relating to the use of the Site. Use of the Site is unauthorized in any jurisdiction that does not
                                give effect to all provisions of these Terms, including, without limitation, this
                                section.<br /><br />You agree that no joint venture, partnership, employment, or agency relationship
                                exists between you and FBL as a result of this agreement or use of the Site. FBL&#x27;s performance of
                                this agreement is subject to existing laws and legal process, and nothing contained in this agreement is
                                in derogation of FBL&#x27;s right to comply with governmental, court and law enforcement requests or
                                requirements relating to your use of the Site or information provided to or gathered by FBL with respect
                                to such use. If any part of this agreement is determined to be invalid or unenforceable pursuant to
                                applicable law including, but not limited to, the warranty disclaimers and liability limitations set
                                forth above, then the invalid or unenforceable provision will be deemed superseded by a valid,
                                enforceable provision that most closely matches the intent of the original provision and the remainder
                                of the agreement shall continue in effect. <br /><br />Unless otherwise specified herein, this agreement
                                constitutes the entire agreement between the user and FBL with respect to the Site and it supersedes all
                                prior or contemporaneous communications and proposals, whether electronic, oral or written, between the
                                user and FBL with respect to the Site. A printed version of this agreement and of any notice given in
                                electronic form shall be admissible in judicial or administrative proceedings based upon or relating to
                                this agreement to the same extent and subject to the same conditions as other business documents and
                                records originally generated and maintained in printed form. It is the express wish to the parties that
                                this agreement and all related documents be written in English. <br /><br /><strong>Changes to
